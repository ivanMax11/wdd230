          <p>Santiago del Estero is typically Mediterranean, with a vast plain crossed by the Sweet and Salty rivers.
          Santiago del Estero is the oldest of the Argentine cities. 
          First it was Juan N√∫√±ez del Prado who founded the city of Ship in 1550 near the Lules river, 
          but it was transferred and refounded in 1551 and 1552 until Francisco de Aguirre took possession of it, 
          moved it for the third time and founded the city of Santiago del Estero del Nuevo Maestrazgo, 
          on the banks of the Sweet River, in 1553. The capital, called ‚ÄúMother of Cities‚Äù, 
          was where colonizing currents departed from, founding many other cities, some of which are today provincial capitals.</p>

          <p>The Unic Stadium Mother of Cities, also called simply Unic Stadium, is a sports venue located in the city of Santiago del Estero, Argentina.
          It was inaugurated on March 4, 2021, hosting the 2019 Argentine Super Cup match between Racing Club and River Plate.
          It was planned to be one of the venues for the 2021 Copa Am√©rica, where the Chile-Paraguay and Uruguay-Paraguay matches would be played, 
          but the competition finally went to Brazil at the request of the Argentine Government to Conmebol, given the increase in cases from covid.</p>

          <p>The Santiago del Estero Forum, Convention and Exhibition Center is a building located in the city of Santiago del Estero (Argentina) that is intended for meetings, 
          congresses, seminars and conventions among other uses.
          It is located in one of the historic buildings of the city that was in disuse: the old Miter railway station, for which it was recovered and put into value. 
          From an architectural point of view, it stands out because it combines the historical with the modern.
          Due to its many and varied features, easy accessibility and its location within the city, the Forum is the most appropriate space for holding important business, 
          training, cultural, social and artistic events.</p>
